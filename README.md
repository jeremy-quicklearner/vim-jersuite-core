# vim-jersuite-core

'Jersuite' is the name of a set of Vim plugins which I've hopefully
written by the time you're reading this. Those plugins require some common
infrastructure to interact with each other correctly, and that infrastructure
is here in the vim-jersuite-core plugin.

Since vim-jersuite-core will only ever be used directly by other Vimscript
developers (and I'd consider myself lucky if anyone but me ever uses it),
its documentation doesn't extend beyond comments in the code and a general
overview in doc/vim-jersuite-core.txt. There's no centralized API Reference.
