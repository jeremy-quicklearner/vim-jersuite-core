1. Intro                                          *jersuite* *jersuite-core-intro*

    'Jersuite' is the name of a set of Vim plugins which I've hopefully
written by the time you're reading this. Those plugins require some common
infrastructure to interact with each other correctly, and that infrastructure
is here in the vim-jersuite-core plugin.

    Since vim-jersuite-core will only ever be used directly by other Vimscript
developers (and I'd consider myself lucky if anyone but me ever uses it),
its documentation doesn't extend beyond comments in the code and a general
overview here. There's no centralized API Reference.

==============================================================================

2. Versioning for Jersuite Plugins                            *jersuite-version*

    Vim does not advocate any particular scheme for plugin dependencies, so we
plugin developers need to come up with our own schemes. Jersuite plugins share
one such scheme.

    Each Jersuite plugin has a script in it called the root script, which is
not autoloaded. The root script defines a global variable g:<PLUGIN>_verion
where <PLUGIN> is some string unique to that plugin.

The value of g:<PLUGIN>_version is a string of the form

       <major>.<minor>.<patch>

where <major>, <minor>, and <patch> are non-negative whole numbers. As changes
are introduced to the plugin, these values are incremented. A value resets to
0 when the value to its left changes. For example, a change of 1.1.1 -> 1.2.0
is possible, but a change of 1.1.1 -> 1.2.1 is not allowed.

    A <major> value of 0 indicates that the plugin is is still under
development and anything about it may change at any time.

    A <major> value of 1 or greater indicates that the plugin is ready for
distribution. An incremented <major> value indicates the presence of large
changes that will likely break use cases of the plugin, in ways that may
require significant work to fix

    An incremented <minor> value indicates a change that adds new features or
may break use cases of the plugin, in a way that should be relatively simple
to fix

    An incremented <patch> value indicates some small change that should have
no noticeable negative impact or large positive impact on a reasonable use
case of the plugin

   A Jersuite plugin enforces dependencies by reading the g:<PLUGIN>_version
of the plugins it depends on, and aborting if it does not see the correct
versions. This dependency check happens in the root script, BEFORE the
definition of g:<PLUGIN>_version, so the dependent plugin's root script must
run after the root scripts of the plugins being depended on.

    As a result, the Vim user is responsible for running the root scripts in
the correct order. This is reasonably simple to do with the Vim-plug plugin
manager (https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug).

                                                                   *JerCheckDep*
    For Jersuite plugin developers, vim-jersuite-core provides the `JerCheckDep`
command:

    `JerCheckDep` <name> <depname> <depwhere> <depminver> <depmaxver>

This command should be invoked from the root script, right before the
initialization of g:<PLUGIN>_version. The arguments are:

    <name>:      The <PLUGIN> string of the current plugin
    <depname>:   The <PLUGIN> string of the plugin being depended on
    <depwhere>:  Some string describing a location where the plugin being
                 depended on can be found
    <depminver>: Mimimum (inclusive) version of the plugin being depended
                 on (in <major>.<minor>.<patch> format) 
    <depvermax>: Maximum (exclusive) version of the plugin being depended
                 on (in <major>.<minor>.<patch> format)

3. Jersuite Core Facilities                                *jersuite-facilities*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.1. Logging                                              *jer_log* *jersuite-log*

    vim-jersuite-core includes a logging system for Jersuite plugins to use.
Each log statement has a level and a facility, which vim-jersuite-core uses
to decide whether to log the message to a buffer, print it to the Vim
messages, or discard it.

                                            *JerLog* *JerLogClear* *jersuite-buflog*
    The buffer messages get logged to is named jersuite_buflog. It is
initialized by vim-jersuite-core as unlisted, and the user may open it in the
current window by invoking the `JerLog` command. Another command,
`JerLogClear`, clears the buffer.

There are seven log levels:
   CRT: With its current configuration, Vim will never function        *log-CRT*
        correctly ever again unless something is fixed
   ERR: Something is wrong and it's probably going to cause trouble    *log-ERR*
        until Vim is restarted
   WRN: Something is wrong but it probably won't cause any trouble     *log-WRN*
   CFG: Information about plugin configurations                        *log-CFG*
   INF: An alert about some change in Vim's state                      *log-INF*
   DBG: Low-level information that isn't of interest to users          *log-DBG*
   VRB: Very low-level information that isn't of interest to anyone    *log-VRB*
        except determined developers

                                                    *JerLogSet* *jer_log#SetLevel*
    Each facility is assigned two levels - one is the threshold for logging to
the buffer, and the other is the threshold for printing to the Vim messages.
The levels for a facility can be set by the user at runtime using the
`JerLogSet` command, which tab-completes the facility and levels. To create a
facility and set its levels, plugins should internally call jer_log#SetLevel.

                                              *jer_log#Log* *jer_log#LogFunctions*
    To log a message, a plugin invokes the jer_log#Log function and passes the
desired facility and level as strings. This is cumbersome in scripts with lots
of logging, so vim-jersuite-core provides the jer_log#LogFunctions function.
jer_log#LogFunctions returns a dict of lambdas that allow for much terser
logging:
>
    call jer_log#SetLevel('myfacility', 'INF', 'WRN')
    let s:Log = jer_log#LogFunctions('myfacility')
    
    call s:Log.INF('Here is some information')
    call s:Log.DBG('The value of myvar is ', myvar)
    call s:Log.CRT('Oh no, everything is broken!')
<
Note that these logging functions are variadic. What gets logged is the result
of concatenating the arguments with join().

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.2. CursorHold Callbacks                          *jer_chc* *jersuite-cursorhold*

    Different plugins may want to add autocmds that trigger on the CursorHold
event, but ensure that those autocmds run in a certain order. However, Vim's
behaviour is that when multiple autocmds fire on the same event, those
autocmds execute in the order in which they were registered. That means the
plugins don't have control over the order - the Vim user does, by choosing in
what order to install the plugins (and therefore, in what order to register
their autocmds).

    This facility allows plugins to decide the order by maintaining a
'CursorHold Callback' list and calling all the callbacks in it whenever the
CursorHold event fires. Each callback is registered with a priority value so
that plugins can control the order in which the callbacks execute. Since only
one CursorHold autocmd gets registered (the one that runs the callbacks), Vim
has no say about the ordering.

    CursorHold callbacks are registered by calling the jer_chc#Register
function:

jer_chc#Register({callback}, {data}, {cascade},               *jer_chc#Register*
                 {priority}, {permanent},
                 {inCmdWin}, {global})

    {callback} is the function to run on the CursorHold event, and it must be
a funcref. {data} is the arguments to pass to {callback}, and it must be a
list.

    If {cascade} is truthy, autocommands can execute as side effects of the
callback.  This effect cascades to side effects of those autocommands and so
on. Callbacks with lower {priority} value go first.

    The callback will only called once, on the next CursorHold event, unless
{permanent} is true. In that case, {callback} will be called for every
CursorHold event from now on.

    Callbacks with a falsey {inCmdWin} flag will not run while the
command-line window is open.

    If {global} is truthy, {callback} will execute even if the user switches
to another tab before the next CursorHold event. Otherwise, the callback will
run on the next CursorHold event that triggers in the current tab

    Since the CursorHold autocmd event doesn't fire in active terminal
windows (i.e. terminal windows that are in terminal-job mode), the CursorHold
callbacks also run whenever the cursor enters an active terminal window.
Specifically, the TerminalOpen and WinEnter events are used for this.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.3. Mode Detection                                     *jer_mode* *jersuite-mode*

    Detecting the current mode from Vimscript is a finicky process. Vim
provides a mode() function, but that function needs to be called while still
in the mode being detected... and the usual ways of executing Vimscript put
Vim into normal mode. vim-jersuite-core offers a solution: call mode() during
the evaluation of expr-mappings. The mappings iit uses are in
plugin/vim-jersuite-core.vim. Using mappings is somewhat cumbersome because if
the mapping is invoked from Vimscript with a 'normal "<plug>JerDetectMode"',
the mapping doesn't have access to the script's scope and so the detected mode
can't just be stored in a local variable. Instead, vim-jersuite-core uses a
script-local variable called s:detectedmode to store the mode. That variable
has a setter called jer_mode#ForcePreserve and a getter
called jer_mode#Retrieve.

So the intended usage is:
>
    normal "<plug>JerDetectMode"
    let preservedmode = jer_mode#Retrieve()

    " Do things that may mess up the mode

    call jer_mode#ForcePreserve(preservedmode)
    call jer_mode#Restore()
<
Alternatively, if the mode (but not the details) is already known:
>
    call jer_mode#Detect('v') " We know we're in visual mode, but we don't
                              " know where the start and end of the selection
                              " are
    let preservedmode = jer_mode#Retrieve()

    " Do things that may mess up the mode

    call jer_mode#ForcePreserve(preservedmode)
    call jer_mode#Restore()
<
A reckless plugin developer may be tempted to skip the setter and getter, and
rely on global state:
>
    normal "<plug>JerDetectMode"

    " Do things that may mess up the mode

    call jer_mode#Restore
<
But please do not do this - it is asking for trouble. Some autocmd could fire
and change the script-local variable at any time.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.4. Legacy Winids                                        *jer_win* *jersuite-win*

    Vim-native winids were only introduced with Vim 8.0. Jersuite plugins
aiming for compatibility with earlier versions of Vim will benefit from
vim-jersuite-core's reimplementation of winids, which does not rely on the
Vim 8.0 feature. Not every winid-related function is reimplemented - more can
be added as they are needed. 

                                                            *jer_win#WinFunctions*
    To use these reimplemented 'legacy winids', scripts may call
jer_win#WinFunctions() to retrieve a dictionary containing replacements for
some of Vim's winid-related functions:
>
    let s:win = jer_win#WinFunctions()
    let id = s:win.getid()
    let nr = s:win.id2win(id)
    call s:win.gotoid(id)
<
    If legacy winids are being used, this dictionary is populated with
functions that reimplement winids in Vimscript. Otherwise, the dictionary
entries just point to their respective native functions. There is also a
'legacy' flag that is 1 if legacy winids are being used, and 0 otherwise

                                                   *g:jersuite_forcelegacywinid*
    vim-jersuite-core uses legacy winids if the Vim version is older than 8.0,
or if the g:jersuite_forcelegacywinid flag is set to a truthy value before
jer_win#WinFunctions() is autoloaded.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.5. Utilities                                          *jer_util* *jersuite-util*

    This facility contains miscellaneous utility functions for Jersuite
plugins:

                                                                      *JerWindo*
`JerWindo` ..... Just like windo, but restore the current window when done

                                                                  *JerWindofast*
`JerWindofast` . Just like Windo, but disable all autocommands for fast
               processing

                                                                      *JerBufdo*
`JerBufdo` ..... Just like bufdo, but restore the current buffer when done.

                                                                      *JerTabdo*
`JerTabdo` ..... Just like tabdo, but restore the current buffer when done.
